# Folkol's RX for Java

Writing a Java-implementation of [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io) sounds like fun! :)

> **N.b.** Like most other projects on this GitHub account, this hack is only intended education and recreation. _If you want to use RX in a real Java app, use instead [Netflix's implementation](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) instead._
