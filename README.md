# Folkol's RX for Java

This is intended to be a bare-bone implementation of [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io) â€” for several reasons. Partially because I am a lazy bum, but also in order to keep things simple enough for the core concepts of RX to be visible by reading the code or stepping with a debugger.

> **N.b.** Like most other projects on my GitHub, this hack is only intended for education and recreation. _If you want to use RX in a real Java app, use instead [Netflix's implementation](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) instead._

## Build
